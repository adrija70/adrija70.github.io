### Goal
The goal of this book chapter was to explore and highlight various techniques for producing bioenergy in the form of biohydrogen gas using sewage sludge, an abundantly available waste resource.

### My contribution
I contributed to conducting an extensive literature survey and writing the manuscript, focusing on the processes and methodologies involved in biohydrogen production.

### Results
The chapter provides a comprehensive and detailed explanation of the techniques used in bioenergy generation from sewage sludge, emphasizing the scientific principles, technological advancements, and practical applications.

### Impact
Biohydrogen production from anaerobic sewage sludge offers a dual benefit of converting waste into a clean and renewable energy source while addressing critical waste management challenges. Furthermore, advancements in microbial engineering and pretreatment technologies have the potential to enhance hydrogen yields, making this approach a sustainable and economically viable solution for transitioning to a hydrogen-based energy economy.
