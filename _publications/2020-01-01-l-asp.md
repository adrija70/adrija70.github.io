### Goal
To conduct and compile a comprehensive literature survey on the extensive investigation of L-asparaginase as an anticancer agent, highlighting its therapeutic potential and associated limitations.


### Limitation
I carried out an in-depth literature survey and contributed to the writing and editing of the manuscript, ensuring a cohesive and well-structured presentation of the findings.


### Impact
This book chapter offers a thorough overview of the extensive research on L-asparaginase as an anticancer agent, shedding light on its therapeutic efficacy and the challenges associated with its clinical application. By critically addressing the enzyme's limitations, including immunogenicity and rapid clearance, the chapter highlights the need for innovative strategies such as enzyme modification, targeted delivery, and combination therapies. This comprehensive analysis serves as a valuable resource for researchers and clinicians, fostering a deeper understanding of L-asparaginase's role in cancer treatment and paving the way for improved therapeutic approaches.
