### Goal
This review article aimed to survey the available strategies for encapsulating L-asparaginase to mitigate its side effects and enhance its efficacy as an anticancer agent, ultimately presenting a comprehensive analysis of the literature.


### My contribution
I conducted the literature survey, structured the manuscript, and contributed significantly to the writing and organization of the review.

### Impact
Conjugation and encapsulation of L-asparaginase are transformative strategies that enhance its anticancer potential by increasing therapeutic efficacy while addressing associated limitations. L-asparaginase depletes asparagine, an amino acid critical for cancer cell survival, particularly in leukaemia. Conjugation techniques like PEGylation or encapsulation in nanoparticles or liposomes facilitates targeted delivery, minimizes off-target toxicity, and ensures sustained enzymatic activity within the tumor microenvironment. These approaches significantly improve the therapeutic index of L-asparaginase, overcoming challenges such as rapid clearance and immune responses, thereby advancing the development of safer and more effective cancer treatments.
